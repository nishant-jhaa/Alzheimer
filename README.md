# Alzheimer's Bioactivity Prediction

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive brain disease affecting a majority of senior citizen across the globe and it gets worse as the time passes. Recent advancements in machine learning have shown that Alzheimer’s can be diagnosed effectively in early stages to support patients. However, just diagnosis of disease is not enough. We need treatment for Alzheimer’s in less possible time as currently there is no cure for it. This repository explains a Quantitative Structural Activity Relationship (QSAR) model with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to discover compounds having drug like properties for development of drugs to treat AD. Drug discovery is a complex process that takes years to come from labs to market. This tedious task can be managed by using machine learning techniques which can significantly improve the time taken for drug discovery by conventional process.
